Uses bit image to kind of visualize how a genetic algorithm works

AI is a very primitive, homemade approach to impolementing a genetic algorithm
AI has no information about the answer except the closest two results of the last generations
Then it uses those two inputs to create a new generation to get closer

Warning: depending on the grid dimensions you choose, display can look a bit wonky.

For example: recreated a 9x9 image in only 46 generations with a 5000 generation size

(And yes, comments are terrible because I built it in like an hour for fun)
